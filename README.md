## Adapt and critique
From a scale of 1-10, I would rate the well structuredness of their website a **7.** I think they have an excellent execution of visual hierarchy and they've also utilized the company colot well. On the first glance, their website appears to be decent looking with the typical site elements such as a nav bar, hero section, cards, and etc. However, there were some flaws that needs to improved such as these elements:
- ![Wonky alignment](assets/flaws/alignment.png)
  - When minimized, their comes to a certain point that the texts are outside the container.
- ![Broken Map](assets/flaws/map.png)
  - Their map is not working.
- ![Broken picture](assets/flaws/no-pancake.png)
  - Some pictures are not showing.  
I think these flaws are very noticeable and needs to be paid attention to because it hinders the functionality of the website. 

I think one should choose Denny's over it's competitor's because they have a lot to offer. Compared to McDonald's, they have bigger portions and better food quality albeit being a bit pricier. It is worth the money and the people can guarantee that whatever food they want Denny's probably has it on their menu. Also, there are not a lot of places especially here in Calgary where you can sit down and eat steak at 3am. So I think their operating hours is their big market opportunity/advantage.

This website relates to my Strapi project because this industry and this company is something that I am very familiar with. As someone who works at Denny's, I can use my knowledge on the field to translate it on the web. The insights that I have is helpful for me in navigating the site and creating the web flow and contents.
