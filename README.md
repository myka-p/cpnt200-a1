## Adapt and critique
From a scale of 1-10, I would rate the well structuredness of their website a **7.** On the first glance, their website appears to be decent looking with the typical site elements . There were some flaws that needs to improved such as these elements:
- ![Wonky alignment](assets/flaws/alignment.png)
  - When minimized, their comes to a certain point that the texts are outside the container.
- ![Broken Map](assets/flaws/map.png)
  - Their map is not working.
- ![Broken picture](assets/flaws/no-pancake.png)
  - The pictures are not showing.
